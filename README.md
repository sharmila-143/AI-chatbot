This project is designed as an interactive AI chatbot that supports text generation. Users can type messages or questions into the prompt area, and the chatbot responds intelligently using a powerful AI model. It's useful for answering questions, explaining concepts, generating creative content, or simply having conversations â€” similar to how ChatGPT works.

In addition to text, the chatbot also supports image-based generation. Users can upload an image along with their prompt, and the image is processed and sent to the AI for visual understanding. This feature is helpful for asking questions about images, identifying objects, or generating responses based on visual content, making the chatbot more versatile and interactive like modern AI tools such as Gemini Vision or ChatGPT with image input.
